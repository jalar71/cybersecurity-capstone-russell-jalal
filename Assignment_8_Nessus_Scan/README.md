# Assignment 8 â€“ Nessus Vulnerability Scanning

In this assignment, Nessus Essentials was installed on a Linux VM and migrated to an ESXi server. The VM was used to scan two legacy systems â€” Windows XP and Windows 7 â€” for vulnerabilities. Both machines were scanned for misconfigurations and known CVEs, with particular focus on SMB-based exploits.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Nessus Essentials
- Ubuntu VM (Nessus server)
- VMware ESXi
- Windows XP & Windows 7 VMs (targets)

## ðŸŽ¯ Scan Targets

See `scan_targets.txt` for system details.

## ðŸ“Š Summary of Findings

| Host         | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info |
